// Which tools a voice session offers.
//
// The agent chat routes its catalog per message. A voice session fixes its
// tools at the start, and every one of them is part of every request. With a
// local model that is the cost of the first answer: the whole catalog is
// about 6100 prompt tokens, which Qwen3.5-9B on an M5 Pro takes 13.7 s to
// read, and which does not fit a 4096 token window at all. The short set
// below is about 2900 tokens and 6.3 s (measured 06.10.2026).
//
// So a local model gets the short set: what people ask for by voice (look
// something up, read and write files, run a command, do something on the
// screen). A cloud model reads the long catalog in well under a second and
// keeps all of it.
//
// In both cases `computer_use` stays out when `computer_task` is offered. A
// voice session gets tool results as text, so a tool that answers with a
// screenshot is of no use to it; the task tool does the looking.
