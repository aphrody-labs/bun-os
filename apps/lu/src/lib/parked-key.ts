/**
 * R9 (3.0.1): OS keychain parking for a displaced OpenAI-compatible API key.
 *
 * Switching the shared `openai` provider slot to a different backend (or
 * turning the current one off) used to leave the outgoing backend's API key
 * with nowhere permanent to go: F3 (Nachbesserung 6) parked it in
 * `providers.openai.displaced.apiKey`, a plain store field that survives
 * Enable/Disable within the running session but is stripped out of
 * localStorage before every write (`providerStore.ts`'s `partialize`), so a
 * restart between "switch away" and "switch back" always lost it.
 *
 * R9 adds a real place for it to live: a second, narrow account namespace in
 * the OS keychain (`secret_park_set`/`_get`/`_delete`, `src-tauri/src/commands/secret.rs`),
 * separate from the four fixed provider slots so it cannot collide with a
 * real account. This module is the thin TS-side glue: turning a backend's
 * display name into the `[a-z0-9-]{1,64}` id the Rust command requires, and
 * telling "no keychain on this device" apart from "the id was rejected"
 * (a bug here, not a fallback signal).
 *
 * What must never happen, checked by this module's own tests: the key value
 * itself, or a rejected id, reaching `console`, a thrown `Error` message, or
 * any other logged/telemetry surface.
